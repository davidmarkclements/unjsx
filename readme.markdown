# unjsx

This module is similar to JSX, but provided as a standards-compliant ES6 tagged
template string function.


# compatibility

[Template strings][1] are available in:
node 4+, chrome 41, firefox 34, edge, opera 28, safari 9

If you're targeting these platforms, there's no need to use a transpiler!
